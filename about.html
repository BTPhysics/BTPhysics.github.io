  <h1>About this site</h1>
  <p>
      I created this site as a BT student and a physics enthusiast. I think that the public finds physics to be an unapproachable subject that is difficult, but through my videos, I hope that you find that to not be the case. The goal of this site is to promote learning and encourage the love of physics. I recommend that you attempt the problems first before watching my videos, as you will be able to see the places where you made mistakes. I do not want this site to become a place for you to copy your homework, as I believe that does not help you learn. However, regardless of your intentions, this site will be up and all the videos and links will be accessible.

    Here, you will find tutorials based upon Bergen County Technical School's physics curriculum. We will add tutorials for freshman year first, then AP Physics 2. Hopefully we will also be able to incorporate other subjects as well. I also plan to stream questions you might have on Twitch in the weeks leading up to the final.

    Questions, comments, concerns, can all be directed to BTPhysicsSite@gmail.com
